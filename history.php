<p> This is good old Grandma Beth.  Beth is Tony's Mom who taught Tony everything he knows
    about cooking.  Beth and her husband grew up in Staten Island and had one of the 
    biggest cow farms in the area.  When the time was right, Beth decided it was time to sell
    all of her land and go live in Vermont.

<p>This is Tony's wife named Valentine as she plays with our horse Charlie.  After Beth passed away,she left everything into
her one and only son Tony.  She loved Tony so much and after teaching everything
she knows, she knew could trust the farm in Tony's hands.  Tony met Valentine at a local
club.  He is not usually into that kind of scene, but he was getting lonely
and tired of doing all the work on the farm, so he knew he needed a wife and children
to help him do all this work.  After Tony had 12 children to work his farm,
he started getting bored and decided to start a restaurant.
